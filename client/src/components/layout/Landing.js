          Our mission at Story Arcadia is to give artists in any given industry the ability to collaborate with other like-minded artists. It is a place where opportunity is given to grow and learn through new media and old. Are you looking to write your first book? Looking to bring your art installation to a nearby arboretum? How about execute and fund that screenplay you've been sitting on? Need help finding musicians to create a CD? We want artists to feel nurtured in our environment while given the chance to discover new ways of incorporating their Creativity more in markets where talent is at a shortage. Our focus through this discovery is to help bring community back to the cultivated artist where constructive support from their peers is paramount. We provide the tools needed to help YOU get YOUR project off the ground. This is a dummy text so I can practice and see if I can save it on git hub.  Added more dummy text.


        This space also serves to provide companies in the production arena to have an added resource in aiding their projects through media and talent. Our goal is to bridge the gap between the starving artist market with working artists and the production arena.
